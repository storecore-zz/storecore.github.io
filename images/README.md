# StoreCore.io photos and images


## Image dimensions

Add high-resolution photos in five common sizes.  Use a suffix in the image
file name to indicate the image width and height.

| 16:9 size       | Width | Height | Suffix       |
| --------------- | -----:| ------:| ------------ |
| 5K              |  5120 |   2880 | `-5120x2880` |
| 4K UHDTV        |  3840 |   2160 | `-3840x2160` |
| Full HD (FHD)   |  1920 |   1080 | `-1920x1080` |
| Wide XGA (WXGA) |  1366 |    768 | `-1366x768`  |
| RDF metadata    |  1200 |    675 | `-1200x675`  |

If the file size of a photo is to large at 4K (3840 by 2160 pixels), it MAY be
scaled down to 2K (2048 by 1080 pixels).
