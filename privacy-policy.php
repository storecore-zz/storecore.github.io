      title="web analytics">web analytics</a> service provided by Google, Inc.
      (www.google.com).  Google Analytics uses <dfn>cookies</dfn>, i.e. text
      files stored on your computer to enable analysis of your website
      usage.</p>
    <p>Information generated by cookies about your website usage is usually
      transmitted to a Google server in the United States, where it is stored.
      Because <abbr title="Internet Protocol">IP</abbr> anonymization is
      active on this website, your <abbr title="Internet Protocol">IP</abbr>

    <p>On behalf of the operator of this website, Google will use this

    <h2>Use of Google Ads conversion tracking</h2>
    <p>This website uses <a
      href="https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/1722022?hl=en"
      rel="noopener">Google Ads conversion tracking</a>, a <a
      href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_analytics" rel="noopener">web
      analytics</a> service of Google, Inc. (“Google”).  Google Ads conversion
      tracking also uses <dfn>cookies</dfn>, which are small text files that are
      stored on your computer system to facilitate an analysis of how you use
      the website.  These cookies lose their validity after 90 days and do
      not contain any information that can be used to identify you
      personally.  When a cookie is still valid, we can see that the user
      clicked on an ad from Google and proceeded to our page.  Every Google
      Ads customer receives an individual cookie.  Therefore, Google Ads
      customers cannot track cookies via their websites.</p>
    <p>The information collected using the cookie is used to create conversion
      statistics for Ads customers who have opted for conversion tracking.
      Customers learn about the total number of users who have clicked on their
      ad and were forwarded to a conversion tracking tag page.  However, they
      do not receive any information that can be used to personally identify
      the user.</p>
    <p>If you wish to opt-out from conversion tracking, you will have to
      deactivate the Google Ads conversion tracking cookie in your browser
      settings.  After doing so, you will no longer be accounted for in the
      conversion tracking statistics.</p>

    <p>Retargeting technology makes it possible for us to address users who have
      already shown interest in our products with personalized, interest-based
      advertising.  The displayed advertisements are based on an analysis of
      previous user behaviour using cookies.  <dfn>Cookies</dfn> are small text
      files that are stored on your computer or mobile device and do not save
      any personally identifiable information of the user.  With retargeting
      technology, a cookie is stored on your computer or mobile device in order
      to record anonymous data about your interests.  Advertisements are then
      adapted individually based on the stored information.  This allows users
      to see advertisements that are highly likely to match their product and
      information interests.</p>
    <p>You can permanently opt out from Google’s placement of cookies on your
